# Augmented Lagrangian Quadratic Program Solver
This library provides an Augmented Lagrangian solver for Arduino projects. It allows to solve 
quadratic programs with by linear equality and inequality constraints (both optional). It is extremely lightweight as all linear algebra operations are done with the [BasicLinerAlgebra library](https://github.com/tomstewart89/BasicLinearAlgebra), it therefore should be able run on any Arduino board. The Augmented Lagrangian formulation is very much based on one of the homeworks I did when following [the CMU optimal control and reinforcement learning course](https://optimalcontrol.ri.cmu.edu/) online by Prof. Zachary Manchester. I strongly recommend to anyone
following the course, it is really awesome!
